        <p style="text-align:center">Hello, my name is Mason Curtis. I was born in Syracuse on February 9th, 2008.<br><br></p>
    <p>
        -I grew up with my brother, Martin, my mother, and my father. My father died when I was 10 by committing suicide, so my mother has been caring for us to the best of her ability.
        - Some technology experience that I have is that I have the ability to work the ins and outs of game consoles for starters. I also have experience with coding and running code. The main factor that inspired me to learn to code and develop software is through one key memory I had. I was sitting on the couch with my father when I was very little, probably no older than 3. We had been playing a game together, which was one of the few things we did together while he was still around. We had been playing “Plants Vs. Zombies”, by Popcap, a division of EA Games. This game was the light switch of my head to inspire me to learn more about game development and code.
        My favorite pet I ever had was my cat when I lived in Florida, Honey. She was a tabby(?) who we brought home when I was 6.
        - I started my early school years in the Banford school in Canton where I stayed until the end of Kindergarten. I was quite the smart little kid, with a 10th grade reading level, but with astigmatism. I had two friends that I always would talk and play with, Alden and Brody. When I moved, I was enrolled into the Florida Virtual School System, where I learnt throughout half of the elementary school up to 4th grade without any real friends met or made. In 4th grade, I moved to George Wolf Elementary School in Bath, Pennsylvania. When I returned to the Canton system in 5th grade, That was where I stayed for the remainder of my school career, where I made some good friends, my personal favorite being my friend, Christopher. I have been participating in band class since 5th grade, when I learned the trombone, jazz band off and on since 6th grade, which I also played trombone in, and esports since 9th grade, where we have qualified for playoffs every season.
        - A special friend I made along the way was Christopher C. I met them at the start of 8th grade gym class by the shared interest of not wanting to be in gym and playing lots of Fortnite, a game which was very popular at the time.
        I plan to learn game code to make a game. I plan to use my band skills to probably make the original sound track (OST) to the game I make, or as an employee, help make all of this a group effort.
        - I see myself graduating from SUNY Canton College with a Bachelor's Degree, trying to get a job in 10 years with half-decent pay and insurance, which I would desperately need to own a house without accumulating crippling debt. I also think whilst trying to find a job, I would also start making the outline of the game I'm going to attempt to make.
